# Optimal Fleet Sizing for On-demand Urban Air Mobility Services
## Overview

Urban Air Mobility (UAM) offers a promising solution to urban traffic congestion by enabling on-demand air-based transportation. However, the stochastic nature of passenger demand introduces significant challenges in maintaining high service availabilityâ€”especially vehicle availability at vertiports.

This project develops a closed Jackson network model with passenger loss to capture the dynamics of an on-demand UAM system. We formulate a **profit-maximization problem** that determines the **optimal fleet size** while satisfying a minimum service availability threshold. The model explicitly accounts for demand uncertainty and considers both **proactive fleet provisioning** and **reactive passenger compensation** strategies.

An iterative exact solution search algorithm is implemented to identify:
- The **minimum fleet size** required to meet availability targets
- The **optimal fleet size** that maximizes profit under various compensation scenarios

The model is validated through a Seoul City case study. Results show that:
- A fleet of 40 vehicles maximizes profit under baseline assumptions
- Incorporating moderate to high compensation schemes increases the optimal fleet size (to 48 and 55 vehicles, respectively) but reduces profitability

This framework provides actionable insights for UAM fleet operators and urban mobility planners making data-driven decisions on scalable UAM deployment.
